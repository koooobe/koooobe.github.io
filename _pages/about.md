I am a third-year PhD student in the Department of Mathematics at Brown Univerisity. I am advised by Prof. Yan Guo and Prof. Beno√Æt Pausader. Before that, I was an undergraduate student at the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) , where I studied geometric analysis under the supervision of Prof. Yong Wei.

## Research Interests

I am generally interested in nonlinear PDEs. Specifically, I am interested in the long-time behavior of solutions from nonlinear dispersive PDEs and PDEs in kinetic theory.
