I am a third year PhD student in the Department of Mathematics at Brown Univerisity. I am advised by Prof. Yan Guo and Prof. Beno√Æt Pausader. Before that, I was an undergraduate student at the University of Science and Technology of China, where I studied geometric analysis under the supervision of Prof. Yong Wei.
